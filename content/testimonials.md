<p>To Kim, Ruth and all the wonderful caregivers that have been with my mom the last
two weeks. I want you to know how much Alice and I appreciate the way you
managed to get such a good team pulled together quickly for our mother. We were
severely impressed with the caring nature of everyone that we met, and the way we
saw them interacting with mom. It’s hard to believe that her passing came so quickly
…but she was at home, in her own chair watching TV and very happy and upbeat
when I spoke to her just an hour before which is exactly how she wanted to
transition. Her gentle passing was a blessing to her and to us who love her. Special
thanks to Monique who reacted so quickly, got me on the phone and facilitated me
talking to the police and EMTs, which allowed me to guide them to the “Do not
resuscitate “form and other legal documents that were there in the house. It was a
very tough day for her. Please give her our thanks again. Please keep approaching
this work the way you are…there is such a need for it.</p>

I am a current client of this provider. Fantastic service and genuine caring. The
Nurse provided for the care of my father was prompt, on time and expressed care
and concern for his wellbeing. Will not hesitate to use the services of Flourish in
Place again.

I am a current client of this provider. I&#39;m currently using Flourish In Place&#39;s services
and I&#39;ve never been happier! They go out of their way to do whatever is necessary to
help you. They come 4 days a week for 3 hours each time. I have a heart condition
among other things, so they take me to my doctor and get my medication. They put
my feet up and help me with my compression socks., They do my shopping and
laundry for me, they cook for me and make sure I&#39;m eating. They help me with
bathing and whatever else I may need. I really and truthfully could not be happier!
