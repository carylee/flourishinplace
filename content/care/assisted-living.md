## What is Assisted Living?

Assisted living communities or assisted living facilities (ALFs) help promote health, safety and well-being among the senior residents that live there. Assisted living was developed as a type of senior housing to provide housing, health care and personal care services to seniors in need of assistance with activities of daily living in a more independent environment than a traditional nursing home.

Among assisted living communities there is a wide variation in the level of care that may be provided. Some assisted living communities specialize in providing a supportive and safe environment for seniors who are largely independent but need some minor periodic assistance with activities of daily living or medication management. Other assisted living providers have designed their services specifically for the very frail elderly who need a very high level of assistance on a daily basis. These assisted living facilities have become a substitute for nursing homes and frequently provide many, though not all, of the same care services as a skilled nursing facility. It is important to know what type of environment each assisted living community caters to so that your loved one will be most comfortable.

There are over 36,000 assisted living options to choose from in the United States.
