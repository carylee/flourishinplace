Background and Purpose
----------------------

Flourish in Place’s mission is to engage seniors’ bodies, minds, and
spirits, to help them lead dignified, quality lives in their chosen home
environment. Flourish’s unique Brain Care Program is one way Flourish
fulfills this mission. Flourish offers its unique program of
individualized brain care for two segments of the aging population:

-   People diagnosed with or experiencing dementia, and

-   Cognitively healthy seniors seeking to maintain brain health.

Addressing Cognitive Decline
----------------------------

Scientific research suggests behavioral and lifestyle activities can
reduce the risk of dementia and may even slow progression of dementia.
Studies support positive late-life benefits from:

-   Cardiovascular exercise, nutrition, hydration, sleep

-   Cognitive training activities, and

-   Socialization and support

Benefits of Brain Care Activities
---------------------------------

Strengths-based coaching can prolong functioning in people with early
memory loss, and may delay cognitive declines. Importantly, these
activities often elevate the client’s self-esteem, while reducing stress
for family caregivers, resulting in enhanced qualify of life for clients
and their families.

Personalized Plan of Care
-------------------------

Flourish in Place provides a Masters-level counselor (Brain Care Coach)
who is experienced in supporting individuals suffering from varying
forms and degrees of cognitive impairment. The Brain Care Coach develops
an individualized daily activities plan through:

-   Reviewing records and consulting with multidisciplinary professional
    team

-   Performing cognitive assessment and quality-of-life assessment, and

-   Conducting in-depth interviews with client, care partners, other
    family members.

Individualized plans will vary depending on the client’s individual
interests, life history, cognitive strengths and weaknesses, level of
impairment, and form and phase of dementia.

Team Implementation
-------------------

Flourish’s Brain Care Coach provides special additional training for
Program caregivers, in coordination with training and supervision they
receive for their personal care duties from our Registered Nurse. The
Brain Care Coach supervises Flourish’s caregivers, who facilitate the
client’s personalized daily activity plan. Cognitive and quality-of-life
outcomes are measured at regular intervals. Plan adjustments are made as
needed.

Note: Additional fees apply for intake, assessment, development of
personalized plan of care, and ongoing supervision by Flourish’s Brain
Care Coach.
