**Care Consultation** - We help families by taking time to understand their loved one's unique needs and then customize a care solution for their budget and care requirements. We help evaluate each situation objectively and consult the family on all possible care options that would meet their needs. Call us today to schedule your free in-home care assessment or just talk to one of our certified senior care managers. Ask us about care funding options!

**Our Service Area** -  We serve Central Florida, including all of Orange County, the cities of Orlando, Winter Park, Maitland, Longwood, Altamonte Springs, Casselberry, Lake Mary, Oviedo, Windermere, and Winter Garden, and the communities of Baldwin Park, College Park, East Orlando, Lake Nona, and Celebration.

**Our Caregivers** - We employ totally committed, highly qualified, and carefully selected individuals who are thoroughly background screened, reference checked, drug tested, bonded, and insured, and we pay them highly competitive wages. Our typical caregiver profile is either a Certified Home Health Aide (HHA) or Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) with several years of work experience as a caregiver.

**Veterans and their Surviving Spouses** - Many veterans and their surviving spouses are eligible to be paid for up to 25 hours of free care per week through the little known VA Aid & Attendance Pension Benefit. Our team of accredited VA agents can help you apply for this benefit and get you approved. This benefit can provide funds for care for the rest of your life. Contact us today to find out more information on how we can help you pay for your home care services!
