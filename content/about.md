## Our Vision

A society that consistently demonstrates the special worth of its most elderly and frail citizens through loving care for those individual's spirits as well as their ailing bodies.

## Our Mission

"To provide compassionate and inspiring non-medical in-home care for seniors and disabled people that helps them thrive and *flourish* in the comfort and safety of their own homes."

## Our Core Values

**C**omfort - caring for our clients' health, safety, well-being and quality of life, while honoring their personal choices;  
**A**ffection- showing our clients abundant love, dignity, compassion and empathy;  
**R**espect- respecting all cultures, genders, races, religions, ethnicities; sexual orientations, ages, and disabilities;  
**I**ntegrity- establishing trust through open, honest, and dignified communications with clients and their families, while maintaining private client information in confidence;  
**N**urture- helping each of our clients achieve their optimum individual level of mental, physical and social activity so they can *flourish* in place;  
**G**enerosity- displaying generosity of spirit through a good-hearted, selfless, and caring staff focused on serving clients and their families.   

Three essential questions to ask - to ensure the company you choose has a strong set of core values:

1. Communication - Will I be able to easily communicate with the personal attendant and have continued access to my case manager? This is the core of our approach. We believe that you should never feel there is a lack of control or communication with your personal attendant. For this reason, you are assigned a case manager who is always available, and we provide a "family portal" where family members who have your authorization can communicate directly with your personal attendant through a computer or mobile device.
2. Integrity - Has a sense of trust been established? We believe this is the key to a comfortable relationship and the well being of the client. That's why we carefully screen all of our personal attendants who are members of a professional home care organization. They must also provide a written contract.
3. Performance - Am I confident I will get the professional care promised and that there will be accountability and follow up? Homecare is dynamic; a family's needs can change daily. You chose homecare to allow your loved one to remain independent and retain their quality of life, not to endure more paperwork and problem solving. We make a simple promise: we will be there for your family. If you're not satisfied, we will work with you until you are.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to:

-  recruiting, training and retaining competent staff and compensating them fairly
-  valuing, supporting, recognizing and appreciating our staff who are our greatest asset
-  providing a work environment that encourages personal enjoyment and enhances job satisfaction and performance through recognition and reward
-  developing and maintaining positive relationships with the community, including local home care and health care organizations and their personnel
-  conducting our business in a responsible and accountable manner
-  adhering to the professional code of ethics of the home care industry and applying continuous quality improvement measures

FLOURISH IN PLACE MANAGEMENT BIOS

**Robert “Kim” Lee** and **Melanie Ann Lee** founded Flourish in Place to help seniors and adults with disabilities thrive and flourish while leading dignified and independent lives in the comfort and safety of their own homes.  Kim and Melanie raised three remarkable children while helping care for Melanie’s wonderful mother, Kathryn, who lived a rich life despite dealing with bipolar disorder all her life and suffering later from post-polio syndrome.  Melanie has cared for her intellectually disabled older sister for the past 18 years as Melinda’s court-appointed plenary guardian.  Kim’s mother, Betsy, suffers from severe dementia.  She lives in her own home with the help of compassionate family members as well as paid caregivers.  Kim and Melanie’s life experiences caring for others influenced their desire to help people not merely “age in place” -- but flourish at home.   Kim and Melanie are both Certified Senior Care Managers.

Towards the end of that time, Ruth’s mother suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed on one side.  Ruth and Jim renovated their home to accommodate Ruth’s mother’s special needs.  They moved her into their home, and cared for her there until she passed away.  Ruth’s  nursing knowledge and skill, developed through her lifelong commitment to professional excellence, combined with her personal experience as a family caregiver, make Ruth uniquely suited to provide home distinctive, high quality healthcare services, which truly make a difference in our client’s lives.
