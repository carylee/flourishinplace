## Our Vision

A society that consistently demonstrates the special worth of its most elderly and frail citizens through loving care for those individual's spirits as well as their ailing bodies.

## Our Mission

"To provide compassionate and inspiring non-medical in-home care for seniors and disabled people that helps them thrive and *flourish* in the comfort and safety of their own homes."

## Our Core Values

**C**omfort - caring for our clients' health, safety, well-being and quality of life, while honoring their personal choices;  
**A**ffection- showing our clients abundant love, dignity, compassion and empathy;  
**R**espect- respecting all cultures, genders, races, religions, ethnicities; sexual orientations, ages, and disabilities;  
**I**ntegrity- establishing trust through open, honest, and dignified communications with clients and their families, while maintaining private client information in confidence;  
**N**urture- helping each of our clients achieve their optimum individual level of mental, physical and social activity so they can *flourish* in place;  
**G**enerosity- displaying generosity of spirit through a good-hearted, selfless, and caring staff focused on serving clients and their families.   

Three essential questions to ask - to ensure the company you choose has a strong set of core values:

1. Communication - Will I be able to easily communicate with the personal attendant and have continued access to my case manager? This is the core of our approach. We believe that you should never feel there is a lack of control or communication with your personal attendant. For this reason, you are assigned a case manager who is always available, and we provide a "family portal" where family members who have your authorization can communicate directly with your personal attendant through a computer or mobile device.
2. Integrity - Has a sense of trust been established? We believe this is the key to a comfortable relationship and the well being of the client. That's why we carefully screen all of our personal attendants who are members of a professional home care organization. They must also provide a written contract.
3. Performance - Am I confident I will get the professional care promised and that there will be accountability and follow up? Homecare is dynamic; a family's needs can change daily. You chose homecare to allow your loved one to remain independent and retain their quality of life, not to endure more paperwork and problem solving. We make a simple promise: we will be there for your family. If you're not satisfied, we will work with you until you are.
