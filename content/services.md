## Our Services

Flourish in Place is a licensed home health agency offering non-medical supportive care for seniors and disabled people in their chosen home enviornment. In other words, we are a "private duty agency" that provides home care services. The aim of home care is for seniors to continue living independently in their own home or independent living facility of their choice, perhaps for their entire lives, rather than entering assisted living communities, adult day care centers, nursing homes, or locked-down memory care units. Most people would much prefer to stay as independent as possible and "age in place".  We offer home care solutions designed to help people not just age in place, but _flourish_, in their chosen home environment.  

Home care services should be considered whenever someone wants to keep living where they are, but often needs some help with one or more basic activities of daily living. Maybe you have noticed that a family member is not taking care of herself as well as she did previously--she could use help with bathing, hygiene, dressing, preparing nutritious meals, or just remembering to take her medicine.  Or, perhaps another person handles his personal care activities well, but his life would be better if a friendly, caring individual could drive him to appointments and social events, run errands, handle light housekeeping, and simply be there to provide companionship and emotional support. 

We provide professional and compassionate personal care services in the comfort of the home, apartment, or living facility. Our certified nursing assistants, home health aides, companions, and homemakers, all are W-2 employees, **not independent contractors**. We have chosen them to provide the best care for you or your particular loved one.  They all are covered by workers compensation insurance and liability insurance of $1 million per claim.  All Flourish caregivers are finger-printed, level 2 background-screened, reference-checked, drug tested, certified as free of communicable diseases, bonded, trained, experienced, cherished, and well-paid employees.

Flourish in Place's services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with no minimum daily number of hours. The client or the client's family can pay privately for services by check, any major credit card, or ACH transfers, or a variety of funding sources may be available such as Long Term Care Insurance, Veteran's Aid & Attendance Pension, Workers Compensation, and various "managed Medicaid" plans.

Three essential questions to ask - to ensure the company you choose has a strong set of core values:

1. Communication - Will I be able to easily communicate with the personal attendant and have continued access to my case manager? This is the core of our approach. We believe that you should never feel there is a lack of control or communication with your personal attendant. For this reason, you are assigned a case manager who is always available, and we provide a "family portal" where family members who have your authorization can communicate directly with your personal attendant through a computer or mobile device.
2. Integrity - Has a sense of trust been established? We believe this is the key to a comfortable relationship and the well being of the client. That's why we carefully screen all of our personal attendants who are members of a professional home care organization. They must also provide a written contract.
3. Performance - Am I confident I will get the professional care promised and that there will be accountability and follow up? Homecare is dynamic; a family's needs can change daily. You chose homecare to allow your loved one to remain independent and retain their quality of life, not to endure more paperwork and problem solving. We make a simple promise: we will be there for your family. If you're not satisfied, we will work with you until you are.
